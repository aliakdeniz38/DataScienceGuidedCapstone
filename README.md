## Problem Statement:    
By leveraging data analytics to understand visitor patterns and facility usage, Big Mountain Resort will implement a new pricing strategy and operational improvements that will result in a 15% increase in ticket revenue, a 10% improvement in visitor satisfaction scores, and a 5% reduction in operating costs within the next winter season.

## Context:
Big Mountain Resort suspects they are not maximizing the potential of their facilities. The pricing strategy based solely on market averages does not accurately reflect the value of their facilities, which impacts their investment strategy. They need a data-driven approach to determine the optimal ticket price and identify cost-saving measures without reducing ticket prices.

## Criteria for success:
**Revenue Increase:** Achieve a measurable increase in ticket revenue within the first season after implementing the new pricing strategy.
**Cost Efficiency:** Identify and implement cost-saving measures that do not negatively impact the visitor experience, with a target reduction in operating costs.

## Scope of solution space:
**Data Analysis:** Conduct comprehensive analysis of visitor patterns, facility usage, and pricing models using the provided dataset.
**Pricing Model:** Develop and test different pricing models based on facility value and visitor preferences.
**Operational Efficiency:** Identify areas for operational cost reduction without diminishing service quality.
**Implementation Plan:** Create a detailed implementation plan for the new pricing strategy and operational changes.

## Constraints within solution space:
**Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited to the data provided by the resort. Additional data sources may be required for a more comprehensive analysis.
**Operational Resistance:** Changes in pricing or operations may face resistance from stakeholders or visitors.
**Seasonal Variability:** Visitor patterns and revenue can vary significantly by season, impacting the generalizability of findings.

## Stakeholders to provide key insight:
**Director of Operations:** Jimmy Blackburn
**Database Manager:** Alesha Eisen
**Other Stakeholders:** Resort management, financial team, marketing team, and visitors.
